Handwritten Text Recognition using IAM Dataset in Tensorflow 2.0

The model has been trained on a small subset of IAM dataset with only 10000 images. The model makes use of Embedding Layer and BiLSTM layer.

At the end of 33 epochs, the trained model reports an accuracy of 42% on the training data and an accuracy of 38% on the validation data.
